# Week-2: Exploring Control Structures and Simple Functions
This week, we’ll focus on Lists in python to get comfortable with lists.

## **Day-8: Introduction to Lists**
  - **Tasks**:
    - Using Lists and List Functions  
    - Print the length of the list flowers_list
    - Use indexing to print first, second and last entry of the list
    - Use slicing to print the first three entries and final two entries of the list
    - Remove "globe thistle" from the list
    - Append "snapdragon" to the list
          
  - **Goal**:
     - Summarize the key points of working with lists in Python.
     - Highlight the main concepts like list creation, indexing, slicing, and modifying lists with `.append()` and `.remove()`.

    

- **Day 9**: Practice looping by printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a `for` loop.
- **Day 10**: Use a `while` loop to print a message multiple times, exploring how loops can repeat actions.
- **Day 11**: Create a basic function (`say_hello()`) that prints a greeting when called, introducing the concept of functions.
- **Day 12**: Write a function to add two numbers, demonstrating how functions can accept input and return a result.
- **Day 13**: Reinforce `for` loops by printing numbers 1 through 10.
- **Day 14**: Practice Task — Create a simple program that asks for a user’s name and greets them, combining user input with `print()`.
