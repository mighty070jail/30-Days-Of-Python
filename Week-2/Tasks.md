# Week-2: Exploring Control Structures and Simple Functions

This week, we’ll focus on basic control structures (`if` statements, loops) and simple functions to build foundational programming skills.

- **Day 8**: Learn to check if a number is greater than a specific value using an `if` statement.
- **Day 9**: Practice looping by printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a `for` loop.
- **Day 10**: Use a `while` loop to print a message multiple times, exploring how loops can repeat actions.
- **Day 11**: Create a basic function (`say_hello()`) that prints a greeting when called, introducing the concept of functions.
- **Day 12**: Write a function to add two numbers, demonstrating how functions can accept input and return a result.
- **Day 13**: Reinforce `for` loops by printing numbers 1 through 10.
- **Day 14**: Practice Task — Create a simple program that asks for a user’s name and greets them, combining user input with `print()`.
