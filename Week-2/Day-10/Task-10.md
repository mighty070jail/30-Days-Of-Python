# Day 10 Task: Predicting List Lengths

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, [2, 3]]
c = []
d = [1, 2, 3][1:]

# Put your predictions in the list below.
# Lengths should contain 4 numbers, the first being the length of `a`,
# the second being the length of `b`, and so on.
lengths = []
```

#### **Task:**
1. Predict the lengths of the lists `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` without using the `len()` function.
2. Write your predictions in the `lengths` list.

#### **Challenge:**
After making your predictions, verify them by calling `len()` on each list and check if your predictions are correct.

```python
# Example:
print(len(a))  # Verify length of 'a'
print(len(b))  # Verify length of 'b'
print(len(c))  # Verify length of 'c'
print(len(d))  # Verify length of 'd'
```
