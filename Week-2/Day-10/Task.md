What are the lengths of the following lists? Fill in the variable `lengths` with your predictions. (Try to make a prediction for each list *without* just calling `len()` on it.)
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, [2, 3]]
c = []
d = [1, 2, 3][1:]

# Put your predictions in the list below. Lengths should contain 4 numbers, the
# first being the length of a, the second being the length of b and so on.

lengths = []
