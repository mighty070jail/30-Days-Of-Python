# Day-5: Using Multiple Variables

Itâ€™s common for code to use multiple variables, especially when calculating complex problems with various inputs. Using variables improves code readability and makes it easier to verify and update calculations.

### **Task-1**: Calculate the Number of Seconds in 1 Year
#### **Task-2**: Compute the Number of Seconds in 4 Years

We need to calculate the total number of seconds using the following variables:

```python
num_years = 4
days_per_year = 365
hours_per_day = 24
mins_per_hour = 60
secs_per_min = 60
```
Write a Python script to perform the above calculations and verify the result: 1)31,536,000 seconds. 2)126,144,000 seconds

### Why Use Variables?

- **Readability:** Using variables like `num_years` and `days_per_year` makes it easier to follow the logic.
- **Error Reduction:** Variables allow for better tracking and debugging of each part of the calculation.
- **Flexibility:** Updating input values becomes simple. For example, accounting for leap years involves updating just one variable: `days_per_year`.

### Update to Include Leap Years

To improve accuracy, we can account for leap years by updating:

```python
days_per_year = 365.25
```

This slight change recalculates the total seconds while keeping the rest of the code intact.
