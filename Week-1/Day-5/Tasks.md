### **Day 5: Introduction to Data Types**
- **Task**: 
  - Define variables with different data types: a string (e.g., a name), an integer (e.g., age), and a float (e.g., a GPA or height).
  - Use `print()` to display each variable along with its type in a sentence, e.g., `"The variable [name] is a string with the value 'John'."`
- **Goal**: Recognize and understand basic data types.
