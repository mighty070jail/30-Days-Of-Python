### Day 1: Introduction to `print()`

**Objective**: To introduce beginners to the basic concept of outputting text to the screen using Pythonâ€™s `print()` function. This will help them become comfortable with seeing their code produce visible results.

**Tasks**:

1. **Basic Usage of `print()`**:
   - Write a simple Python program that uses the `print()` function.
   - The program should print `"Hello, World!"` to the console. This is a classic first program that allows learners to see how Python can display text.
   
2. **Custom Message**:
   - After the `"Hello, World!"` message, add a second `print()` statement to display a message of their choice (e.g., `"Learning Python is exciting!"` or `"I am ready to code!"`).
   
**Goal**:  
To get comfortable writing and running Python code, seeing the output in the console, and understanding the purpose of `print()` for displaying information. 

This first exercise sets the foundation for writing more interactive programs as they progress.
