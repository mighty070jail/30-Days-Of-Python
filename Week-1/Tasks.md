# Week 1: Python Fundamentals

### **Day 1: Introduction to `print()`**
- **Task**: 
  - Use the `print()` function to display a message.
  - Print `"Hello, World!"` and an additional message of their choice (e.g., "Learning Python is exciting!").
- **Goal**: Get comfortable with `print()` for outputting text.

---

### **Day 2: Working with Variables**
- **Task**: 
  - Create variables for their name, age, and favorite color.
  - Use `print()` to display them in a sentence, e.g., `"My name is [name], I am [age] years old, and I love [color]."`
- **Goal**: Understand variables and how to store and use data.

---

### **Day 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations**
- **Task**: 
  - Define two numbers and display the result of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing them.
  - Example: Define `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 5`, then output their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
- **Goal**: Learn basic arithmetic operators in Python.

# **Day 4: Python Exercises**

## **Exercise 1: Basic Variable Creation and Printing**
1. Create a variable `x` and assign it the value of 10.  
2. Create another variable `y` and assign it the value of 20.  
3. Print the values of `x` and `y`.  

---

## **Exercise 2: Swapping Variables**
1. Create two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign them values 5 and 10 respectively.  
2. Swap their values (so `num1` becomes 10 and `num2` becomes 5).  
3. Print the new values of `num1` and `num2`.  

---

## **Exercise 3: Combining Strings and Variables**
1. Create a variable `name` and assign it your name.  
2. Create another variable `greeting` and assign it the value `"Hello, "`.  
3. Combine `greeting` and `name` into a single message and print it.  

---

## **Exercise 4: Updating Variables**
1. Create a variable `counter` and set it to 0.  
2. Increment `counter` by 5 three times (using `+=`).  
3. Print the final value of `counter`.
4.

# Day-5: Using Multiple Variables

#### **Task-1**: Calculate the Number of Seconds in 1 Year
#### **Task-2**: Compute the Number of Seconds in 4 Years

We need to calculate the total number of seconds using the following variables:

```python
num_years = 4
days_per_year = 365
hours_per_day = 24
mins_per_hour = 60
secs_per_min = 60
```

# Day-6: Explore and Practice Python Data Types

## Part 1: **Create Variables with Different Data Types**
1. Define variables with the following data types: integer, float, boolean, and string.
2. Print each variable along with its type using the `type()` function.
---


## Part 2: **Perform Operations with Strings**
1. Concatenate two strings and print the result.
2. Multiply a string by an integer and print the repeated string.
3. Use the `len()` function to find the length of a string.
---


## Part 3: **Work with Booleans**
1. Create boolean variables using expressions (`5 > 3`, `10 == 15`, etc.).
2. Use the `not` operator to invert a boolean's value.
3. Print the results and their types.
   
```

## Part 4: **Explore Floats**
1. Create a float variable with a fractional value.
2. Use the `round()` function to round it to 2 decimal places.
3. Print the original and rounded values.
---

### **Day 5: Introduction to Data Types**
- **Task**: 
  - Define variables with different data types: a string (e.g., a name), an integer (e.g., age), and a float (e.g., a GPA or height).
  - Use `print()` to display each variable along with its type in a sentence, e.g., `"The variable [name] is a string with the value 'John'."`
- **Goal**: Recognize and understand basic data types.

---

### **Day 6: Simple `if` Statements**
- **Task**: 
  - Write a program that checks if a number (provided by the user) is greater than, less than, or equal to 10.
  - Print a message based on the comparison, e.g., `"The number is greater than 10"`, `"The number is less than 10"`, or `"The number is equal to 10"`.
- **Goal**: Understand conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

---

### **Day 7: Creating Simple Loops**
- **Task**: 
  - Create a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 through 5.
  - Create a `while` loop to print `"Python is fun!"` three times.
- **Goal**: Practice creating and controlling loops.
