# Week 1: Python Fundamentals

### **Day 1: Introduction to `print()`**
- **Task**: 
  - Use the `print()` function to display a message.
  - Print `"Hello, World!"` and an additional message of their choice (e.g., "Learning Python is exciting!").
- **Goal**: Get comfortable with `print()` for outputting text.

---

### **Day 2: Working with Variables**
- **Task**: 
  - Create variables for their name, age, and favorite color.
  - Use `print()` to display them in a sentence, e.g., `"My name is [name], I am [age] years old, and I love [color]."`
- **Goal**: Understand variables and how to store and use data.

---

### **Day 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations**
- **Task**: 
  - Define two numbers and display the result of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing them.
  - Example: Define `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 5`, then output their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
- **Goal**: Learn basic arithmetic operators in Python.

---

### **Day 4: Getting User Input**
- **Task**: 
  - Write a program that asks the user for their favorite animal.
  - Display a sentence using that input, e.g., `"Your favorite animal is [animal]."`
- **Goal**: Learn to gather input using the `input()` function.

---

### **Day 5: Introduction to Data Types**
- **Task**: 
  - Define variables with different data types: a string (e.g., a name), an integer (e.g., age), and a float (e.g., a GPA or height).
  - Use `print()` to display each variable along with its type in a sentence, e.g., `"The variable [name] is a string with the value 'John'."`
- **Goal**: Recognize and understand basic data types.

---

### **Day 6: Simple `if` Statements**
- **Task**: 
  - Write a program that checks if a number (provided by the user) is greater than, less than, or equal to 10.
  - Print a message based on the comparison, e.g., `"The number is greater than 10"`, `"The number is less than 10"`, or `"The number is equal to 10"`.
- **Goal**: Understand conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

---

### **Day 7: Creating Simple Loops**
- **Task**: 
  - Create a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 through 5.
  - Create a `while` loop to print `"Python is fun!"` three times.
- **Goal**: Practice creating and controlling loops.
