### **Day 6: Simple `if` Statements**
- **Task**: 
  - Write a program that checks if a number (provided by the user) is greater than, less than, or equal to 10.
  - Print a message based on the comparison, e.g., `"The number is greater than 10"`, `"The number is less than 10"`, or `"The number is equal to 10"`.
- **Goal**: Understand conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
