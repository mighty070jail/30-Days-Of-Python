# **Day 4: Python Exercises**

## **Exercise 1: Basic Variable Creation and Printing**
1. Create a variable `x` and assign it the value of 10.  
2. Create another variable `y` and assign it the value of 20.  
3. Print the values of `x` and `y`.  

---

## **Exercise 2: Swapping Variables**
1. Create two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign them values 5 and 10 respectively.  
2. Swap their values (so `num1` becomes 10 and `num2` becomes 5).  
3. Print the new values of `num1` and `num2`.  

---

## **Exercise 3: Combining Strings and Variables**
1. Create a variable `name` and assign it your name.  
2. Create another variable `greeting` and assign it the value `"Hello, "`.  
3. Combine `greeting` and `name` into a single message and print it.  

---

## **Exercise 4: Updating Variables**
1. Create a variable `counter` and set it to 0.  
2. Increment `counter` by 5 three times (using `+=`).  
3. Print the final value of `counter`.  

---

## **Optional: Exploring Errors**
1. Try to create a variable with a name starting with a number (e.g., `1var = 5`) and observe what happens.  
2. Create a variable `my-var` with a hyphen and note the result.  
3. Fix the errors by using valid variable names.

### **Goal**  
- Practice basic Python operations like creating variables, manipulating their values, swapping variables and combining strings.
