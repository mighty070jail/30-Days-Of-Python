# Week 3: Working with Basic Data Structures

This week, we introduce basic data structures—lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. These structures are essential for organizing and managing data.

- **Day 15**: Create a list of favorite foods and practice accessing each item.
- **Day 16**: Add and remove items from a list, using `append()` and `remove()`, to understand list manipulation.
- **Day 17**: Define a basic dictionary with details like name, age, and favorite color, and learn to access values.
- **Day 18**: Add a new item to a dictionary, then print the updated dictionary.
- **Day 19**: Experiment with sets by creating a small set of favorite colors and printing each item.
- **Day 20**: Introduce tuples as immutable lists, creating a simple tuple and printing each item.
- **Day 21**: Practice Task — Create a list of friends' names, then use a loop to greet each friend, building on lists and loops together.
