# Week 4: Slightly Advanced Control Structures, Functions, and Data Handling

In the final week, we’ll expand on our skills with more advanced control structures, functions, and data handling tasks to build logical thinking.

- **Day 22**: Write a program that checks if a user’s age is in the teenage range, combining conditionals and input.
- **Day 23**: Use a loop with an `if` condition to print even numbers, reinforcing loop and conditional logic.
- **Day 24**: Create a function to square a number, exploring functions that accept parameters and return values.
- **Day 25**: Write a function that counts vowels in a string, using loops and string operations.
- **Day 26**: Use a `while` loop to keep asking for positive input until the user complies, reinforcing input validation with loops.
- **Day 27**: Calculate the sum of a list of numbers using a loop, demonstrating how to work with lists in calculations.
- **Day 28**: Practice Task — Ask for five names, store them in a list, and print a greeting for each, combining input, lists, and loops.

## Final Days

- **Day 29**: Review and test all programs from Week 4 to ensure functionality, focusing on debugging and refining code.
- **Day 30**: Final Task — Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number, a practical exercise combining loops and arithmetic.
